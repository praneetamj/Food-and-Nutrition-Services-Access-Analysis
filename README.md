# Project 3 ‚Äì Food and Nutrition Services Access Analysis

This project analyzes the distribution, accessibility, and trends of food and nutrition-related services across neighborhoods. Through data visualization and geospatial mapping, the project identifies disparities and service coverage patterns to inform community-level planning and interventions.

---

## üìå Objectives

- Analyze availability of food and nutrition resources by zip code and neighborhood
- Explore service distribution by category, geography, and population density
- Create interactive visualizations for stakeholder and community awareness

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

**Source:** Publicly available community health and nutrition service data  
**Includes:**  
- Zip code and tract-level service locations  
- Service categories (e.g., food banks, WIC centers, community meals)  
- Demographic overlays (where applicable)

---

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, plotly, geopandas)
- Jupyter Notebook
- HTML/JavaScript (for dashboard and map visualizations)
- Google Colab

---

## üìä Analysis Overview

- **Service Categorization:** Aggregated data by type of food/nutrition service
- **Geospatial Mapping:** Visualized resource density and gaps using choropleth and scatter maps
- **Trend Analysis:** Tracked changes in service availability across time or location (if data allowed)

---

## üìÅ Deliverables

- Colab notebook (`food and nutrition.ipynb`)
- Interactive HTML visualizations:
  - Density maps
  - Service category distribution
  - Zip code and ward-level drilldowns
- PDF project report
